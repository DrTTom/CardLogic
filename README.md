# CardLogic

To manage a collection of stamps, of books or of any kind of "collectible"
objects you will find many software solutions. Collecting stuff which comes
without catalouges, labels or dating is an entirely differnt world.

This project is for two purposes:

* getting more familiar with some JS techniques, provide examples for teaching
* helping me organize my collection of playing cards

Its organized as JavaScript front end connecting via REST to a Java back end.
Both parts constist of a generic base which could be used for any kind of
collection and an extension which makes it suitable for handling the special
needs of playing card collectors.

Why is collecting playing cards different?
* There is no exhaustive catalouge or reference.
* There are rather few collectors.
* Cards may or may not have maker signs, covers ...
