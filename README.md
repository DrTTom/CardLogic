# Collection

This project is for two purposes

* being a sand box for trying out techniques which do not (yet) occur in my professional work
* helping me organize my collection of playing cards

It consists of two parts: a generic application which can be used to keep track of any kind of collection and a customization 
for handling the special needs of playing card collectors.
